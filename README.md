# Task 4: Setup and Use a Firewall on Windows

## Objective
The goal of this task was to configure and test basic firewall rules on Windows to allow or block traffic. I specifically tested blocking inbound traffic on port 23 (Telnet) and verified that the rule worked by attempting a local connection.
